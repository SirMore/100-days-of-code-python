**Today's Progress**: Today was review of the very basic python stuff. I reviewed print and input statements, manipulations of strings and variables.\
I have created a program generating a band name from user inputs.

**Thoughts:** Very easy topics treated but a good starting point for this exciting journey of the challenge.

### Day 2: September 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still going through the basics. Today I reviewed the major data types (str, int, float, bool) in python, mathematical operators using the PEMDAS_LR, rounding, formatting and F-Strings.

**Thoughts:** I really have a great time going through the material and building the tip calculator app. I am planning on creating a mobile version of it.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
