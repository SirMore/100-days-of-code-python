# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 02, 2021
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Today was review of the very basic python stuff. I reviewed print and input statements, manipulations of strings and variables.\
I have created a program generating a band name from user inputs.

**Thoughts:** Very easy topics treated but a good starting point for this exciting journey of the challenge.

### Day 2: September 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Still going through the basics. Today I reviewed the major data types (str, int, float, bool) in python, mathematical operators using the PEMDAS_LR, rounding, formatting and F-Strings.

**Thoughts:** I really have a great time going through the material and building the tip calculator app. I am planning on creating a mobile version of it.

### Day 3: September 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed conditional statements, comparison and logical operators, code block and scope.

**Thoughts** It was interesting to use nested if/elif/else statements, multiple if statements. I had fun building the [leap year calculator](https://github.com/SirMore/100-days-of-code-python/blob/master/Projects/Day_003/leap.png), love_calculator and [treasure_island](https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Treasure%20Island%20Conditional.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1oDe4ehjWZipYRsVfeAx2HyB7LCQ8_Fvi%26export%3Ddownload) games. Good revision of functions like lower() and count() and how to include [ASCII art](https://ascii.co.uk/art) with print('''     '''').

### Day 4: September 05, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on randomization and python lists. I reviewed the random module and some of its functions (random(), randint(), choice(),...) and used lists and nested lists.

**Thoughts** Great content and I am happy to have built a Rock Paper Scissors game to play against the computer.

### Day 5: September 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed the For loop, the range function, random function and code blocks.

**Thoughts** I built a very useful password generator using list comprehension, loops, random.shuffle(*list*), and ''.join(*list*).

### Day 6: September 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I covered Python functions, code blocks and the While loop.

**Thoughts** I really enjoy the Reeborg Maze debugging cases. This was very challenging especially the random walls challenging.

### Day 7: September 08, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I successfully built a hangman game with Python.

**Thoughts** The game was very fun and allowed me to go over some topics that had already been reviewed in the first 6 days: modules, loops, conditional and math operators, and list comprehension.

### Day 8: September 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed python functions with inputs.

**Thoughts** I have built a great Caesar Cipher app to encode and decode meassages.

### Day 9: September 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed Python dictionaries and nesting.

**Thoughts** I have built an auction program.

### Day 10: September 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I went over Python functions with outputs and recursion.

**Thoughts** I have built a calculator program.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
